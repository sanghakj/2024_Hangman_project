# 2024_Hangman_project

This was a part of the preliminary interview round from one of the firms.

250k English words are given. We would like to propose a hangman-solver. However, the testset words are not included in that 250k words. How should we train the model?

The actual test were done at the firm's server so here we only upload the report(.ipynb) and modified source file(.py).
