# 2024_Hangman_project

This was a part of the preliminary interview round from one of the firms.

Trainset "words_25000_train.txt" includes 250k English words. We would like to propose a hangman-solver by only training the given trainset. However, it is know that the testset words will be only given from outside of the trainset. How should we train the model?

The actual test were done at the firm's server so here we only upload the report(.ipynb) and modified source file(.py).
